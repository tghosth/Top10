# +A: What's next for CIOs / CISOs

## Manage the full Application Lifecycle

Applications belong to the most complex systems humans regularly create and maintain. IT management for an application should be performed by IT specialists who are responsible for the overall IT lifecycle of an application. We suggest establishing the role of application managers as technical counterpart to the application owner. The application manager is in charge of the whole application lifecycle from IT perspective from collecting the requirements until the process of retiring systems, which is often overlooked.

## Requirements and Resource Management

* Collect and negotiate the business requirements for an application with the business, including the
protection requirements with regard to confidentiality, authenticity, integrity and availability of all data assets, and the expected business logic.
* Compile the technical requirements including functional and non functional security requirements.
* Plan and negotiate the budget that covers all aspects of design, build, testing and operation, including security activities.

## Request for Proposals (RFP) and Contracting

* Negotiate with internal or external developers the requirements, including guidelines and security requirements with respect to your security program, e.g. SDLC, best practices.
* Rate the fulfillment of all technical requirements including a planning and design phase.
* Negotiate all technical requirements including design, security and service level agreements (SLA).
* Adopt templates and checklists, such as [OWASP Secure Software Contract Annex](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Secure_Software_Contract_Annex).
**Note**: Please note that the Annex is a sample specific to US contract law, and is likely to need legal review in your jurisdiction. Please consult qualified legal advice before using the Annex.

## Planning and Design

* Negotiate planning and design with the developers and internal shareholders, e.g. security specialists
* Define the security architecture, controls, and countermeasures appropriate to the protection needs and the expected threat level. This should be supported by security specialists.
* Ensure that the application owner accepts remaining risks or provides additional resources.
* Each sprint, ensure security stories are created for functional requirements, and constraints added for non-functional requirements.

## Deployment, Testing and Rollout

* Automate the secure deployment of the application, interfaces and of all components needed, including required authorizations.
* Test the technical functions and integration with the IT architecture and coordinate business tests.
* Create "use" and "abuse" test cases from technical and business perspectives.
* Manage security tests according to internal processes, the protection needs and the level of security required by the application.
* Put the application in operation and migrate from previously used applications if needed.
* Finalize all documentation, including the CMDB and security architecture.

## Operating and Changes

* Operating including the security management for the application (e.g. patch management).
* Raise the security awareness of users and manage conflicts about usability vs security.
* Plan and manage changes, e.g. migrate to new versions of the application or other components like OS, middleware and libraries.
* Update all documentation, including in CMDB and the security architecture, controls, and countermeasures, including any runbooks or project documentation.

## Retiring Systems

* Any required data should be archived. All other data should be securely wiped.
* Securely retire the application, including deleting unused accounts and roles and permissions.
* Set your applicationâ€™s state to retired in the CMDB.
